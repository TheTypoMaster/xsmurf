tcl_cruncher Changes log :
--------------------------
1.11 @braces in comments (like everything) were completly ignored. In tcl
     they aren't (!) and can really 'close' a opened brace (!).
     (thx to Dan Schenck for pointing this out)
     tcl_cruncher now allows this (but warn 'cause its not imo a good coding
     practice). It also keep up /warn about brace (un)matching inside comments.

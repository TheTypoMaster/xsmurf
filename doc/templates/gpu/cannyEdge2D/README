#
# This directory contains a CUDA project for computing 2D Canny edge
# on NVIDIA GPU.
# 
# To compile, copy this directory into NVIDIA's SDK projects sub-directory
# and type make. Then put the resulting executable somewhere in your path.
#
# There is also a pure C-language implementation (cannyEdge2D_host.c).
# A comparison benchmark done on a Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU 6420  @ 2.13GHz 
# equiped with a graphics board GeForce 8800 GTS (320 MB of RAM) with OS
# Ubuntu 7.10 (64 bits) shows that you can reach an acceleration factor of
# x8 to x11 by running this Canny edge detector on the GPU instead of the CPU.
#
# To use it in xsmurf, you just need to replace the wtmmg loop by a shell call
# to cannyEdge2D_cuda (located in your CUDA SDK binary sub-dir).

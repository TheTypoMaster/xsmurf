Here are some test script that go step by step through the
computations of the WTMM "edges" for 2D/3D scalar/vector fields.

Try to source one of the following script in xsmurf console:
(see comments inside scripts for more informations).

2D scalar data:
test_wtmm2d_follow.tcl
test_wtmm2d.tcl  

2D vector field data:
test_wtmm2d_vectorfield.tcl  

3D scalar data:
test_wtmm3d_brownian.tcl  
test_wtmm3d.tcl

3D vector field data
test_wtmm3d_vectorfield.tcl
